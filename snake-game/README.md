This game brings me back to the days before smartphones - snake was the only thing that made my phone interesting!

Leveraging 'keydown' event listeners, you are able to move your snake around the board with the arrow keys as he searches for food. Each time he finds food to eat, he grows slightly longer. The game is over if the snake accidentally leaves the board.

To play the game yourself:
- clone this repository
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- use `npm run start` to spin up the server
- enjoy!
